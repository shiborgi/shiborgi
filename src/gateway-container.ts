/**
 * The gateway container: this install's only route off the host.
 *
 * Topology, and why it is this one:
 *
 *   [agent]  ── nanoclaw-egress-v2-<slug> (hostOnly, no internet) ──┐
 *                                                                   ├─ [gateway]
 *                                            default (NAT) ─────────┘      │
 *                                                                          └──> upstreams
 *
 * The gateway is multi-homed: one leg on the install's host-only network where
 * the agents live, one on the NAT network that has a route out. Agents reach
 * it at its host-only address and can reach nothing else — not the internet,
 * not another install's gateway.
 *
 * Nothing is published to the host. Two earlier shapes were tried and
 * rejected against the live runtime:
 *
 * - `-p <hostOnly-gateway-ip>:8080:8080` fails outright (`Can't assign
 *   requested address`): that address exists on the host only while the
 *   network has a member, which is circular — the gateway would have to be
 *   running for the gateway to be able to start.
 * - `-p 8080:8080` binds 0.0.0.0, putting the gateway on every host interface
 *   including the LAN, and forces a distinct host port per install.
 *
 * Multi-homing needs neither. It also means the address is DHCP-assigned, so
 * it is resolved fresh on every spawn rather than cached — a gateway that was
 * recreated comes back at a different IP and the next session simply learns it.
